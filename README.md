# DarkButTransparent_BDTheme
A BetterDiscord theme I have made that replaces dark mode with a transparent one. 

To use it copy the DarkButTransparent.theme.css file and its contents and put it in your themes folder.
The theme can be updated for the most part automatically so you wont have to constantly come here for updates.
